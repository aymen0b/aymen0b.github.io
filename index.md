## About me

  I am currently working as a research engineer at the Atomic and Alternative Energy Commission (CEA), Saclay-France. I am investigating the use of homomorphic encryption in practice.
  Previously, I finished a PhD jointly between Telecom SudParis and the University of Pierre and Marie Curie ([UPMC](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/)), Paris-France. My topic was on the proposal of new authentication protocols for wireless mesh networks with the use of identity-based cryptography. From 2013 to the end of 2017, I worked as a security engineer at "Institut de Recherche en Technologie SystemX". I worked on risk analysis and security evaluation of autonomous vehicles embedded networks.


  My main research topics are:

  - Network security: authentication, risk analysis, performance analysis of security protocols
  - Applied cryptography: homomorphic encryption, lightweight crypto and id-based crypto
  - Past and current projects: ANR Mobisend, FP7 TWISNET, ELA, ISE, CTI, H2020 Konfido,...
